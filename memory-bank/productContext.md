## User Stories for Galaxy Animation System

   ### US01: As a site visitor, I want to see a 3D starfield background so that the website has an immersive space theme.
   - **Acceptance Criteria:**
     - [ ] The background is rendered using Three.js
     - [ ] The animation runs at 60fps on modern desktop browsers
     - [ ] The animation does not block the main thread

   ### US02: As a site visitor, I want to interact with the galaxy by moving my mouse to change the perspective so that I feel engaged with the site.
   - **Acceptance Criteria:**
     - [ ] Mouse movement causes the camera to rotate
     - [ ] The rotation is smooth and responsive
     - [ ] The rotation speed is configurable via parameters

   ### US03: As a site visitor, I want to see different types of celestial bodies (stars, planets, nebulae) so that the galaxy feels rich and varied.
   - **Acceptance Criteria:**
     - [ ] At least three distinct celestial body types are present
     - [ ] Each type has a unique visual appearance
     - [ ] The distribution of bodies follows a natural pattern

   ### US04: As a site owner, I want the galaxy animation to be performance-optimized so that the site loads quickly and runs smoothly on most devices.
   - **Acceptance Criteria:**
     - [ ] The animation uses WebGL and is GPU-accelerated
     - [ ] The number of particles is optimized for performance
     - [ ] There is an option to reduce the quality for low-end devices
